# Mars App

### Summary

The Mars App is a great tool that allows users to report alien encounters to the space police.

### Tools and methods

The building of this application consists of using AngularJS.

Other tools and methods used include:
* HTML/CSS (SASS)
* Accessing the API with a GET and POST request
* Flexbox layout
* Gulp
* Git and GitHub
* MVC architecture

### Experience

I found Angular easier to pick up compared to React because I feel there is an obvious pattern that can be repeated through each page. I think it is a very powerful framework and I can't wait to learn more about it.
